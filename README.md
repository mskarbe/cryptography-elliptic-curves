## Motivation

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) leverages algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields in order to generate public keys. It can solve the problem of performance-heavy operations with too large keys (f.ex. 2048-bit RSA), as usually for ECC 256 bits are used.

## Tools used

The tasks were realized in Python with use of Jupyter Notebook, in order to be able to embed the code easily in the report and to have nicely formatted mathematical formulas. The results are exported to pdf.
